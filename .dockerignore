# Uploads folder - CRITICAL
# If the 'uploads' folder contains temporary files from previous local runs
# or test data that shouldn't be in the production image, ignore it.
# The Dockerfile creates an empty 'uploads' directory within the image.
# If you have some *essential* files that MUST be in uploads at build time,
# then you would not ignore it, but this is rare for a typical uploads dir.

# Dummy face - if it's only for local testing and not needed by the deployed app,
